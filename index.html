								Hello, my name is Laksh Woosaree.  I am a second-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Alberta and over the past year, I have gained valuable experience with 3D modeling and analysis. I have been involved in projects that have expanded my experience with leadership, budgeting, team management, and system integration. 
								My personal interests include 3D printing, photography, and skill learning. In my spare time, I enjoy socializing with my friends and occasionally playing sports or video games. As you explore this site, you will learn more about each aspect of my life!

								<p style = "font-family:Font Awesome 5 Brands Regular;font-size:18px;font-style: normal; font-weight: 500;">
									<b>Who am I?</b><br> I feel like this question is impossible to answer. The better question is who am I not? Throughout my life, my continuous endeavors have exposed me to a variety of experiences - those for which I am extremely grateful. It’s been quite the journey...where do I even start?
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/1e.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<br>
									<b>Curiosity.</b> <br>
									I have always been a bit mischievous to be quite honest. However, underneath it all lies a curious mind navigating the world. Every device I’ve ever owned either has been used to its very last breath or alternatively has been dissected apart into its components. The urge to do the latter has always been second nature. It all started with a single talking Elmo stuffed toy. How did it talk? No way it could talk, right? Well, I had to figure out. So Elmo was ripped into pieces. Now, this surely doesn’t sound like the most humane solution of discovery, however, it soon developed into learning the mechanisms behind day to day devices. From remotes, to phones, to RC toy cars, the inner workings of these seemingly complicated devices fascinated me. It just seemed so mind-boggling that these small networks of circuitry and mechanical systems could accomplish so much. If only I had the knowledge to understand them though…
									<br><br>
									<b>Knowledge.</b> <br>
									Education has always been an integral part of my life. An eagre passion to learn drives me every day to challenge myself. Anything from learning abstract concepts to participating in competitions, I always try to push myself in my academic pursuits. Between elementary and high school, I competed in 12 math competitions and have placed in the top 10% of Canada. So I guess you can say I can add and subtract numbers or something like that. My inclination towards mathematics and science has been apparent since day one, but my appreciation for other subjects is highlighted by my interest in understanding human nature. Reading deep into literature is quite intriguing as it captures a moment in time in such a compact form. From thoughts to moments in history, it is difficult not to be intrigued in the words of someone else. As such, despite being a passionate engineer, my fondness for creative reading and writing prevailed throughout highschool. Balancing everything together allows me to bring abstract concepts into an alternate lens that others rarely see. The world is full of patterns; it is just a matter of noticing them. So what am I trying to say here? I’m pretty smart...but hey, life is all about balance. 
									<br><br>
									<b>Dedication.</b><br>
									Diversification is an integral part of life. As such, I spend as much time as I can experiencing other aspects of life. Anything from sports, to music, to hobbies, I enjoy keeping myself actively working on something. 
									<br><br>
									From as young as I can remember, sports have been a key aspect of my life. I started in community soccer when I was 4 years old. I loved the sport, and my recesses were full of nothing but soccer for over a decade. I would practice excessively with my dad to the point his hips were about to give out. By the age of nine, I transitioned over to Tae-kwon-doe. I learned about the fundamentals of discipline while learning various self-defense maneuvers. In my 8 years of Tae-Kwon-Do I have achieved several accolades including several provincial titles and a gold medal in a tri-provincial tournament.
									I will forever be grateful for these experiences as they have brought me across Western Canada and have allowed me to meet a large variety of people from different backgrounds. 
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/tkw.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<br><br>
									<span class="tab"> </span>Music always has and always will be a massive part of my life. I can hardly think of a point in time to which music has not been an interest. I have participated in band for 4 years and have received distinction in cities and provincial music festivals. I have also had the opportunity to be a part of Alberta Junior Honour Band for 3 years in a row to play in the Jubilee Auditorium. 
									Additionally, I have done jazz band for 3 years and have had the opportunity to meet and talk to local musicians. Despite no longer pursuing band, I still enjoy playing the guitar every now and then. Oh did I mention I love listening to songs? For countless hours every day, I listen to a wide variety of tunes. The symphony of emotions is one that is elegant and perfectly exemplified in music. There is a niche for everyone and I recommend music to anyone trying to find a pass-time. 
									<br><br>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/band.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									Being a mechanical engineer, it should not be a surprise that I love tinkering and making things. Over the past year, I have made a 3D printing hub equipped with an FDM-Printer as well as an SLA printer. The use of 3D printing allows for rapid prototyping and even can produce quite excellent 3D models if processed correctly. From replacing small household items to creating tourbillon mechanisms, 3D printing continuously keeps me busy and tests my skills in 3D design. It should not come as a surprise that this continuous passion for creation has led me to found my own club at the University of Alberta. I will talk about this later though under the “Interests” tab of the website. 
									<br><br>
									<b>So who am I?</b><br>
									After all this it seems like I have covered it all. In reality however, it is only a small stone turned from the vast experiences of what makes me...well...me. From my world experiences from traveling to founding the largest student engineering community, there is a lot to say. However, this is all for now. If you were to ask me what has been the largest take away from my life experiences though I would say: 
									<br><br>
									Be passionate about the things you love. Take risks. Fall down. Do it again - but better.

								Photography has always fascinated me. Capturing a single moment in time in a still frame. I have quite a long ways to go in establishing my photography skills, but for now it is a fun past-time. Below is a small library of some nature photography I took over Summer 2020.

								<p style = "font-family:Font Awesome 5 Brands Regular;font-size:18px;font-style:normal; font-weight: 500;">
								Ever since I used a 3D printer for the first time, I knew I had to get one. From small toys to replacement parts for household items, it really does it all. In addition to being extremely useful, 3D printing enables me to apply my 3D design skills that I have acquired during my mechanical engineering courses. The result is quite amazing with little to no barriers when undertaking projects. Even if the filament materials is not strong enough, using 3D printers to create custom brackets is extremely useful during rennovations and other projects.
